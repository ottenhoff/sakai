# Sakai Webcomponents rules

Sakai Webcomponents use LIT

Lint rules are available in webcomponents/tool/src/main/frontend/eslint.config.mjs

Lint rules include no trailing spaces. Use double quotes instead of single quotes.

Webcomponents are internationalized. Never use an OR switch to also provide english text. Just use the i18n property only.
